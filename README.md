# hdl-exchange-format

The hdl-exchange-format is a JSON file that describes an HDL project.

This is a low-level project format: it is not supposed to be written
by users (but generated by higher level tools).

The purpose of this format is to have a common and simple format
between build managers and HDL tools (like IDE, simulators,
synthesizers, linters).

# Tools accepting this format

TODO.
