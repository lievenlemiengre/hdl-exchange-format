# hdl-exchange-format

The hdl-exchange-format is a JSON file that describes an HDL project.

This is a low-level project format: it is not supposed to be written
by users (but generated by higher level tools).

The purpose of this format is to have a common and simple format
between build managers and HDL tools (like IDE, simulators,
synthesizers, linters).

# Tool options

The format should be as generic as possible, so features shared by all
tools should be abstracted.  This obviously includes the list of
files, the libraries and the standard.

But it is also recognized that some features like particular options
cannot be abstracted.  So there is a "tool-options" to set the options
for a specific tool. "tool-options" is an object, whose properties are
tool names.  It is expected that tool names are unique.

# Tools accepting this format

TODO.
